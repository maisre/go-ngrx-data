# go-ngrx-data
Golang backend, angular + ngrx data on the front, no db integration just hardcoded arrays serverside

This is taken as far as I am going to take it. Not finished but what I wanted to get out of this project is done.

Existing problems - possibility of collisions on the server since I am just using a Map intead of an actual data store that would enforce that. UI is garbage but again not the point. 

And probably a bunch I am not aware of.
